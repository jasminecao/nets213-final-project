        <h1>How did we gather the data?</h1>
        <p>First, we created a survey and asked college students what stresses them the most. We chose the most popular options and used crowdsourcing to gather possible advice, tips, and words of encouragment. We used Mechanical Turk for that and first asked Workers to provide advice for the stressors we gathered. Next, we wanted to validate the responses so we decided to ask a new group of Workers if they would feel comfortable giving a specific advice to their family or friends. That way we were able to limit the responses to the most useful ones according to the Crowd. After that, we asked another group of Workers to rate the responses provided. We then averaged the ratings and chose the highest ranked responses according to Turkers. Below, you will find the advice we gathered from the Crowd for the most common stressors. You will also be able to see the rating responses for each stressor got! </p>
