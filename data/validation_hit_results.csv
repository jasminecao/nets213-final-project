But still if you face the same problem than you have to discuss amicably your problem with your roommates. But you have to understand that they also have their own problems so give them space and try to be friendly with them and share your feelings with them.","be patient with them, they are nice people","First you try to understand that the roommates are different people from different culture. Try to minkle with those friends by cooperating their habit.  Some are talking much and some are talking loudly.  But some people are quite silent so any disturbance comes try to join some other activities.","I understand, not everyone enjoys being around loud roommates and those that do no obey the roommate agreement. I would suggest talking to them if you haven't already or if that hasn't worked perhaps you can report them to your Hall's warden or sub-warden via call, in person or email, they should be able to deal with such situations. It is also useful if you have some evidence of your roommates not paying attention to roommate agreement such as, pictures, videos, camera recordings as this may be required for proof.","It's okay to admit a problem. Try to talk to them about your problem and see if they understand your point of view. If they keep doing that behaviours than you can try to retalk to them, or you can escalate the fact to your landlord or try to behave like them seeing if they understand what the problem is.","I definitely  can relate to that feeling and it can be very annoying and unbearable. You can have a conversation about that with your roommate and make him/her realize that it is not favorable for you and that it is against the agreement you had before moving in with you. I'm sure it will resolve the issue.","I recommend telling your roommates that they are being a little too loud. If they don't respect what you say, remind them of the roommate agreement. If they still don't respect what you are saying, you need to find different roommates.","I am so sorry you feel that way. Try talking to them and consult counseling or legal services at the university. You can try talking to the office where your lease is about seeing if they can help. You got this!","I can relate to the way you are feeling but you need to draw your roommates's attention to the fact he or she is being loud and it does not comply to the agreement you had . Do not be overwhelmed with the situation just have the conversation and make sure you reach an understanding.","false","true","false","true","false","true","false","true","false","true","false","true","false","true","false","true","false","true","false","true","true","false","true","false","true","false","false","true"
