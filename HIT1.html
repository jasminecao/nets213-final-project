        STRED is a project whose goal is to provide high quality tips,
        resources, and words of encouragement that will help reduce stress and
        anxiety caused by problems university students encounter every day. Your
        responses will be shown to students to alleviate their stress and
        encourage them.

        In each space, write down 3-4 sentences as a response to the stressor
        displayed below. Responses should include both problem-related advice
        (stress-relief tips, resources, etc) and words of encouragement.

        If your friend or family said this, how would you respond (3-4
        sentences)?
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Problem:</b> I am concerned about finding an affordable and safe
        apartment to live in next year.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Example Answer:</b> Finding a good apartment takes time, so you don’t
        need to worry about it. Check crime rates in the area, ask for
        recommendations from your friends, and check websites like airbnb and
        apartments.com for good prices. Also don’t forget to ask your university
        administrators, who might also live nearby and in safe apartments. You
        got this!

        (The example answer above is NOT good because it lacks specificity and
        provides no advice relating to the problem.)
